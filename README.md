# Democratizing Financial Data with IEX
This project consists of a collection of functions written in Python to request and capture financial data in a structured fashion from IEX developer's application programming interface (API). These functions obtain historical, fundamental, and alternative data for more than 9,000 assets and 5,000 publicly traded common stocks with a maximum range of 5 years.

## What is IEX?
The IEX Group, Inc. operates the Investors Exchange (IEX), a stock exchange regulated by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). The IEX group is on a mission to build fairer markets by fighting against questionable trading practices. IEX offers a free API containing minute by minute and historical data for U.S. Equities and other alternative assets.
